## DXXL NOTES REPOSITORY
this is the official repository of my school notes, this place will be updated and is free to the public (maybe), please take care of these notes

### WHAT IS THIS?
This repository is a collection of the notes i've gathered over the school years, you may or may not find these helpful, ill never know, This repository will continue to update with new notes every once in a while!

Updating this repository will happen usually before exams, so others can have unlimited access of my notes during review week., But i will be closing access once the said exam week is on.

### REASONS WHY I HAVE THIS
mainly to help people get through exams, i'm fond of typing and writing down notes and every time there's a discussion, its either teachers wont send the slides and make us take notes because its our responsibility and also so that i have something to do in class besides listening and i have materials to study as well

### HOW TO GET A COPY?
you may clone the rep by doing this on your linux/MAC/windows terminal, you will need **git clone** installed, I dont use windows so its up to you how to clone or get a copy of the notes

```
git clone https://github.com/dxxl/notes.git
```

GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAMS GUYERS, OR QUIZZES
